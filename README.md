# GUI Tool for Visualizing Infinitesimal Dipole Current Fields

## Overview
This project involves the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for visualizing infinitesimal dipole current fields. The objective is to create an effective and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with, explore, and analyze electromagnetic data through intuitive tools and real-time rendering.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for exploring dipole current fields.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Real-time visualization of electromagnetic fields.
- **Data Representation**: Clear and accurate representation of electromagnetic data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the GUI tool.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI components.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing the electromagnetic fields.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data handling.
